0.06 - Sep 30, 2012
-  Make return values be unsigned integers (they are really pointers)
   Should fix some failing tests

0.05 - Sep 14, 2012

   works for code not built with threading. See 
   https://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=65625
-  Revise documentation to reflect that the return values are OP addresses
   (i.e. unsigned pointer values).
